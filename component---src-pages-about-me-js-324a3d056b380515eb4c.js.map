I'm currently a Front End Senior Software Engineer at Guru.\n          I get to work mostly in React.js and Sass working on our webapp and\n          browser extension. My biggest focus is writing clean and DRY code. I\n          have experience with accessibility and giving users a great\n          experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Woman Developer\">\n            üë©üèº‚Äçüíª\n          </span>\n          Before Guru, I was a Front End Developer at a company formerly known\n          as WebLinc, LLC (now WorkArea), where I worked in HAML, Sass,\n          JavaScript and jQuery, and I occasionally dabbled in Ruby on Rails.\n          Recently, they open sourced their product and one of the Ruby Gems I\n          mostly built still exists and has most of my original code (even\n          though someone else uploaded it to GitHub, my name is still in the\n          author line of the gemspec)!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Woman Teacher\">\n            üë©üèº‚Äçüè´\n          </span>\n          I love to speak and write about my journey into software development,\n          my experiences as I advance within my career, and the occasional dev\n          talk. I previously taught an advanced HTML and CSS concepts class as\n          well as an intro to jQuery class. In November 2018, I co-hosted a talk\n          on how to build a blog website using Gatsby!\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Family and woman chef\">\n            üë´üêïüë©üèº‚Äçüç≥\n          </span>\n          When I'm not developing, I love to hike with my husband (who is also a\n          developer) and our wonderful dog, &Scaron;tafl&iacute;k, or you can\n          find me buried in a cookbook looking for the next thing I want to\n          bake.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        aboutMe\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
