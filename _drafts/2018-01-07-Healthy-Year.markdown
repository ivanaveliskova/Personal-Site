My boyfriend and I started considering buying ourselves a slow-cooker to make cooking a little easier and so meals are ready when we get home from work. So, I went to Facebook to ask about options and what people prefer or recommend. I mainly asked about the difference between a Crock Pot and an Instant Pot and which one I should get but then I also figured I should weigh a few other options into the mix.

So I created a spreadsheet with all of the options, specs, prices to make a comparison between several options and if I honestly really need any of this stuff.

|  Options         | Capacity  |  Price    |  Slow Cooker|  Steamer |  Brown/Sauté | Keep Warm | Rice Cooker |
| :--------:       | :-------: | :-------: |:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:---------:| :---------: |
| Phillips         | 4.2qt     | $140.57   |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |
| Instant Pot Ultra | 6qt       | $149.95   |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |
| Instant Pot Duo Plus  | 6qt       | $119.95   |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |
| Cosori 8qt       | 8qt       | $120.58   |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |
| Cosori 6qt       | 6qt       | $92.95    |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |
| Black+Decker     | 6qt       | $91.32    |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |
| Crock Pot        | 6qt       | $58.98    |      ✅      |    ✅    |      ✅      |     ✅     |     ✅      |

So at first look, most of these are about the same. Have relatively similar features, with just variations in size and price.

|  Options         | Yogurt | Bake/Roast | Pressure Cooker | Stew/Soup | Risotto | Oatmeal |

| Phillips         |   ✅   |     ✅      |        ❌       |    ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅    |
| Instant Pot Ultra |   ✅   |     ✅      |        ✅       |    ❌     |   ❌    |    ❌    |
| Instant Pot Dup Plus  |   ✅   |     ✅      |        ✅       |    ❌     |   ❌    |    ❌    |
| Cosori 8qt       |   ✅   |     ✅      |        ✅       |    ✅     |   ❌    |    ❌    |
| Cosori 6qt       |   ✅   |     ✅      |        ✅       |    ✅     |   ❌    |    ❌    |
| Black+Decker     |   ❌   |     ❌      |        ✅       |    ✅     |   ❌    |    ❌    |
| Crock Pot        |   ✅   |     ✅      |        ✅       |    ✅     |   ✅    |    ❌    |

The settings start veering around here, where some can make yogurt, and have a setting specifically for risotto, and oatmeal, and baking. Also, even though some of the slow cookers do not explicitly have a setting for "bake", the description says you can use it to bake a cake, so I checked off bake/roast for it anyway.

Also, the Phillips slow cooker has individual settings for a lot of fancy schmancy stuff, such as oatmeal and risotto, etc.

|  Options         |   Egg Cooker | Sterilizer | Boil | Hot Pot |    Countertop Size   |
| :--------:       |  :---------: |:----------:|:----:|:-------:|:--------------------:|
| Phillips         |       ❌     |     ❌     |  ❌  |    ❌    | 17.2 x 12 x 13.8in   |
| Instant Pot Ultra |       ✅     |     ✅     |  ❌  |    ❌    | 13 x 12.5 x 12.5in   |
| Instant Pot Duo Plus  |       ✅     |     ✅     |  ❌  |    ❌    | 12.2 x 13.4 x 12.5in |
| Cosori 8qt       |       ✅     |     ❌     |  ✅  |    ✅    | 14.8 x 14.2 x 14.2in |
| Cosori 6qt       |       ✅     |     ❌     |  ✅  |    ✅    | 12 x 12 x 13.25in    |
| Black+Decker     |       ❌     |     ❌     |  ❌  |    ❌    | 12.4 x 12.4 x 13in   |
| Crock Pot        |       ❌     |     ❌     |  ❌  |    ❌    | 13.6 x 11.9 x 13.6in |

Finally, the Cosori slow cookers had some extra settings for boil/hot pot (although I'm convinced the boil setting is essentially the same as stew/soup), which I added just to compare and decide whether or not settings or options such as that are even worth it.

Well, first of all, after reading a few of my cookbooks, their suggestions are to get just a large slow cooker, so that rules out the Phillips. I don't think I need something super large either, so the Cosori 8qt is out.
