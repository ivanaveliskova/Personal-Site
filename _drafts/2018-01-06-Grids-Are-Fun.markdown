The other day, I gave a presentation to my coworkers about the benefits of using a grid system within our Sass. Up until now, we've been using flexbox, since most modern browsers support it now. I showed how we could simplify some of our markup (which was occasionally getting a little hack-y because of the limitations of flexbox for major layouts) and clean up a lot of our styles using grids and flexbox for smaller layouts.
