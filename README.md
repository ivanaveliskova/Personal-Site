# jekyll-template

The beginnings of a brand new and modern template using jekyll! :-D

Right now it is being developed as identical as possible to the originally provided jekyll template when you first create a new site, but using flexbox instead of the bootstrapy columns and floats. Because no one likes float... or weird columns. But flexbox is amazing.

Ok, so I have moved on from the Jekyll base code and have started veering into my own stuff. Still using flexbox for some interesting concepts, but also adding some more areas for customization. Right now, it is kind of gearing towards me and my needs for a website, but soon I hope to change it to a more generic template that can be forked and used and stuff. *BOOM* ~Micdrop~

Flexbox still does what I need it to do. Currently making small updates to keep my site modern and up-to-date while still showing my personality. I personally liked adding a new collection for my portfolio area. I think it helps separate the files in a more readable manner. I don't think I am interested in updating to the latest version of jekyll currently. I like the flexibility I have with my template currently, the current way jekyll is set up doesn't seem to let me build a new template as easily as I did with this.
