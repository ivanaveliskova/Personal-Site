# Hello!

This is my personal site built with Jekyll.

I just learned how to use Jekyll and just worked on the basics and making minimal changes.

Eventually, I would like to create a basic template that would be used for GDI classes and talks.

Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like to learn a little more about Jekyll and how to use it.
