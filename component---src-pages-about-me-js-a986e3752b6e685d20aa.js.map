I'm currently a Front End Senior Software Engineer at\n          Guru. I get to work mostly in React.js and Sass working on our webapp\n          and browser extension. My biggest focus is writing clean and DRY code.\n          I have experience with accessibility and giving users a great\n          experience.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          👩🏼‍💻Before Guru, I was a Front End Developer at a company formerly known\n          as WebLinc, LLC (now WorkArea), where I worked in HAML, Sass,\n          JavaScript and jQuery, and I occasionally dabbled in Ruby on Rails.\n          Recently, they open sourced their product and one of the Ruby Gems I\n          mostly built still exists and has most of my original code (even\n          though someone else uploaded it to GitHub, my name is still in the\n          author line of the gemspec)!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          👩🏼‍🏫I love to speak and write about my journey into software\n          development, my experiences as I advance within my career, and the\n          occasional dev talk. I previously taught an advanced HTML and CSS\n          concepts class as well as an intro to jQuery class. In November 2018,\n          I co-hosted a talk on how to build a blog website using Gatsby!\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          👫🐕👩🏼‍🍳When I'm not developing, I love to hike with my husband (who is\n          also a developer) and our wonderful dog, &Scaron;tafl&iacute;k, or you\n          can find me buried in a cookbook looking for the next thing I want to\n          bake.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        aboutMe\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
