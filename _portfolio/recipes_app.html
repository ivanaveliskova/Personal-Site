    <p class="project__description">I created this simple app to teach myself AngularJS and get some practice in. Working on this app on my own and coming up with ideas for which features would be useful has been difficult. Also as I am building out the features, I am additionally trying to style the site (responsively). Currently, the recipes get alphabetized and dropped into the associated tab. And then as you switch from tab to look at a recipe and come back, using localstorage to remember the tabs. Fortunately, localstorage is supposed by modern browsers pretty well and so this was a good option to use for this feature.</p>
