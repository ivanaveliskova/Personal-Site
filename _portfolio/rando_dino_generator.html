    <p class="project__description">When I was took my first Node.js class with GDI, we built a simple app that essentially works similarly to Jekyll, pulling in partials and layout files and applies variables to each page to make new pages. Node.js is a bit more dynamic, or has more dynamic capabilities than Jekyll, but the thought ws the same. This project essentially took a JSON file and pulled a random number and picked a random dinosaur name from this file. I later took it a step further and pulling in the Wikipedia API and retrieved a bit of information about each dinosaur and displayed it.</p>

    <p class="project__description">Some things I would probably do differently: for one, I think I would try to pinpoint the information I was trying to pull from the Wikipedia API a bit better. The information comes with it's own styling, so I would try to style it slightly differently.</p>

<!-- Should I set a default image? Hopefully I will be consistent on which images I use -->
