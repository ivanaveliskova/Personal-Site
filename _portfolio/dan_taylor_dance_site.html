<p>Work in progress</p>

<p>The live site has been taken down (as Dan and Taylor are not dancing together anymore) but you can see the site as I worked on it locally <a href="http://ivanaveliskova.com/dan-taylor-site/">here</a>!</p>

<!-- Should I set a default image? Hopefully I will be consistent on which images I use -->
