My name is Ivana. That’s Ivana, spelled I-V-A-N-A, but the “I” is pronounced like the Ee in Eevee.

First things first (&ldquo;I’m the realest&rdquo;), let’s talk about the giant elephant in the room. I graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in International Relations, Minor in Computer Engineering. So how did I take the giant leap of faith from IR to web development? Quite frankly, every great web developer needs an incredibly expensive, gold-embossed paperweight for their desk, and at the time, a college degree in IR seemed to be the fastest way to get one. But in all seriousness, like a handful of twenty-somethings out there, I found myself nearing the end of my college career with no idea what I wanted to do, and chose IR so that I could graduate without adding my soul to my growing student loan account. Although I enrolled in courses at BU that ranged from Greek and Roman Mythology to Diplomatic Practice, I always indulged my interest in computers every semester with a course or two in software engineering (hence my minor in computer engineering), and would spend much of my free time playing around in the ether of computer code for fun (Geocities, anyone?).

But I digress. After college, I realized that my degree in world peace looked better on paper than in the real world, and started teaching dance to pay the bills (&ldquo;Can you pay my bills? Can you pay my telephone bills? Can you pay my automobile bills?&rdquo;). Meanwhile, I started taking classes with [Girl Develop It][GDI-link]{:target="_blank"} (GDI, for short) to augment what I had already picked up at BU from my minor in computer engineering. In case you're not familiar with it, GDI is an incredible springboard for women trying to break into the technological industry. They have a very welcoming environment (men can take classes too!) where you can ask the important questions like, &ldquo;What’s an ID?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Why is my code not working? Oh, I forgot a parenthesis&#8230;&rdquo; (these may or may not be actual events) in a safe and supportive environment without feeling like anyone is judging or rolling their eyes at you. From GDI, I was really able to solidify my foundation in web development because I started to understand how code works and what I can do with it. Before I knew it, I was building websites all by myself from scratch.

And then I digressed even more. 

Now, I am a web developer. Simple as that. I am self-motivated, self-taught, and extremely driven in my passion for web development. I really like a simple and clean design with an elegant twist, while still providing a seamless user experience. I do like to dive a lot into user interface over user experience, but then again, I’ve always had trouble making up my mind!  

When I’m not busy trying to figure out how to turn on my computer (kidding&#8230; maybe), I love to bake and occasionally do a little dance. I like to pretend that I’m a decent photographer (although the 400 selfies I have to take before I post just 1 would say otherwise&#8230; Earlybird, anyone?). 

But something most people probably don’t know about me? I AM A NERD AND PROUD OF IT. 

I love Harry Potter, and almost anything by the BBC ([Doctor Who][DW-gingerbread]{:target="_blank"}, Sherlock, The Musketeers, Merlin, etc.) I am a Pokemon Master (see proof [here][poke-master-twitter]{:target="_blank"}) I am wildly competitive in any tabletop game, including (but not limited to) [Settlers of Catan][Catan-winner]{:target="_blank"}, Takenoko, Munchkin (Adventure Time version), Race for the Galaxy, 7 Wonders, and more (I spend a lot of time watching [Wil Wheaton][tabletop-youtube]{:target="_blank"}). I also watch more anime (SAO, Sailormoon, and Fairy Tail, to name a few) than I care to admit. I can solve a Rubik’s cube and drive a manual transmission (though not at the same time&#8230; safety first!). Oh, and secretly, I know I’m a ninja. 

One last thing: I throw out obscure references and quotes like ninja stars because they seem appropriate at the time. 

&ldquo;People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but, actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly&#8230; timey-wimey&#8230; stuff.&rdquo; Brownie points if you know where this is from without looking it up!&#9734;


&#9734;DISCLAIMER: You won’t actually get brownie points, but a brownie in your honor might not be out of the question. (Mmmmmm, brownies.)
